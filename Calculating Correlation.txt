QUESTION:


import pandas as pd

filename = '/datasets/ud170/subway/nyc_subway_weather.csv'
subway_df = pd.read_csv(filename)

def correlation(x, y):
    '''
    Fill in this function to compute the correlation between the two
    input variables. Each input is either a NumPy array or a Pandas
    Series.
    
    correlation = average of (x in standard units) times (y in standard units)
    
    Remember to pass the argument "ddof=0" to the Pandas std() function!
    '''
    return None

entries = subway_df['ENTRIESn_hourly']
cum_entries = subway_df['ENTRIESn']
rain = subway_df['meanprecipi']
temp = subway_df['meantempi']

print correlation(entries, rain)
print correlation(entries, temp)
print correlation(rain, temp)

print correlation(entries, cum_entries)
SOLUTION 1:

cov = np.cov(x, y, ddof=0)[0][1]
return cov / (x.std(ddof=0) * y.std(ddof=0))

SOLUTION 2:
    
return np.corrcoef(x, y)[0][1]
