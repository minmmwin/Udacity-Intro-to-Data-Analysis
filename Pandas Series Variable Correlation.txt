QUESTION:

def variable_correlation(variable1, variable2):
    '''
    Fill in this function to calculate the number of data points for which
    the directions of variable1 and variable2 relative to the mean are the
    same, and the number of data points for which they are different.
    Direction here means whether each value is above or below its mean.
    
    You can classify cases where the value is equal to the mean for one or
    both variables however you like.
    
    Each argument will be a Pandas series.
    
    For example, if the inputs were pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4]) and
    pd.Series([4, 5, 6, 7]), then the output would be (4, 0).
    This is because 1 and 4 are both below their means, 2 and 5 are both
    below, 3 and 6 are both above, and 4 and 7 are both above.
    
    On the other hand, if the inputs were pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4]) and
    pd.Series([7, 6, 5, 4]), then the output would be (0, 4).
    This is because 1 is below its mean but 7 is above its mean, and
    so on.

    num_same_direction = None        # Replace this with your code
    num_different_direction = None   # Replace this with your code
    
    return (num_same_direction, num_different_direction)
    
SOLUTION: 

# Sum of numbers of both x and y > 0 or both < 0
num_same_direction = sum([1 for x, y in zip(variable1-variable1.mean(), variable2-variable2.mean()) if (x>0 and y>0) or (x<0 and y<0)])   

# Sum of numbers of either (x > 0 and y < 0) or (x < 0 and y > 0)
num_different_direction = sum([1 for x, y in zip(variable1-variable1.mean(), variable2-variable2.mean()) if (x>0 and y<0) or (x<0 and y>0)])
